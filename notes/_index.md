# Welcome to my Digital Garden!

This is the place where I share my knowledge with everyone on the Web and with myself.

Notes are drafts or pre-complete materials that I could use for writing articles on [my blog](Blog.md).

I take notes following [[Zettelkasten method]] and I use [[Obsidian]] app for this. Some notes might contain a format that is working in [[Obsidian]] well but could be not supported by my website (yet).

You can start navigating my [[Digital Garden]] here:
