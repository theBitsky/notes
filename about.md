# About me

### I'm Byteski, a software developer.

![photo](/Images/avatar.jpg)

This is my website - the place where I share information and knowledge about topics that interest me with everyone and myself.

I have been working as a developer for several years. Most of the projects are related to web technologies, including UI (front end) side and server side.

I work on the project that build on these following stack: [[TypeScript]], [[React]], [[Node]], [[JestJS]], [[RxJS]] and other great technologies.

I'm fun of static type checkers and languages, especially [[TypeScript]]. Also, I'm interesting in writing tests, using code generators and some cool command-line tools.

Besides programming stuff, I like writing itself, reading weird articles, mechanical keyboards (I'm typing this text on [[Vortex Race III RGB]] with Cherry MX Blue switches), keeping all information that I used somehow in life and taking notes - I do note-taking using [[Zettelkasten method]].

I find the way of learn in public is quite useful so here is my [Digital Garden](/notes).

If you wanna just chat with me - feel free to email me at [me@byte.ski](mailto:me@byte.ski).
